#Problem
#Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a string. 
#Write a program that determines if x is a vowel (a, e, i, o, and u ). 
#If yes, print _ is a vowel, where the blank is the value of x. 
#If no, print _ is not a vowel, where the blank is the value of x.

x = "e"
if x == "a" or x == "e" or x == "i" or x =="o" or x == "u":
  print(x + " is a vowel")
else:
  print(x + " is not a vowel")
