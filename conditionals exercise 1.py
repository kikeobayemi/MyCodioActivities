#Problem
#Use the variable x as you write this program. 
#x will represent a positive integer. 
#Write a program that determines if x is between 0 and 25 or between 75 and 100. 
#If yes, print the message:_ is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100, where the blank would be the value of x. 
#The program should do nothing if the value of x does not fit into either range.

x = 50
if (x>=0 and x<=25) or (x>=75 and x<=100):
  print(str(x)+ " is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100")
