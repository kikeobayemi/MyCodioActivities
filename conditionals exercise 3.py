#Problem
#Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a positive integer. 
#Write a program that determines if x is divisible by 5 and even. 
#If yes, print _ is divisible by 5 and even, where the blank is the value of x. 
#If no, print _ is not divisible by 5 or it is odd, where the blank is the value of x.

x = 40
if x%5 == 0 and x%2 ==0:
  print(str(x)+" is divisible by 5 and even")
else:
  print(str(x)+" is not divisible by 5 or it is odd")
