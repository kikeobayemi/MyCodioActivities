#Problem
#Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a positive integer. 
#Write a program that determines if x is divisible by 5. 
#If yes, print _ is divisible by 5, where the blank is the value of x. 
#If no, print _ is not divisible by 5, where the blank is the value of x.

x = 25
if x%5 == 0:
  print(str(x)+" is divisible by 5")
else:
  print(str(x)+" is not divisible by 5")
